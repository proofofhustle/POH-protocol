# 🚀 Proof-of-Hustle Protocol (POH)  
  
**Proof-of-Hustle (POH)** is a **soulbound NFT protocol** that tracks, verifies, and rewards learning, coding, and contributions on-chain.    
  
Our mission is to transform **education and contributions** into **verifiable, on-chain achievements**, building a transparent system of reputation and incentives for the next generation of developers, students, and builders worldwide.    
  
POH = **Your Grind, On-Chain.**  
  
---  
  
## 🌍 Why Proof-of-Hustle?  
  
Today, millions of students and developers work hard to learn coding, contribute to open source, or complete courses — but their progress often remains **invisible** to the world.    
- Resumes are outdated and unverifiable.    
- Contributions on GitHub or courses are fragmented.    
- Students, especially in emerging regions, lack financial support or recognition.    
  
**POH changes this.**    
By issuing **soulbound NFTs** that **auto-update** with each verified milestone, we create:    
- A **living, on-chain resume**.    
- **Proof of effort and learning** that no one can fake.    
- **Financial incentives** that reward grind and achievement.

## ✨ Features  
  
- 🪪 **Soulbound NFTs (SBTs):** Non-transferable tokens that represent your unique learning journey.    
- ⚡ **Auto-Updating Reputation:** NFTs evolve as you complete courses, build projects, and contribute to GitHub/Devpost.    
- 🎓 **Learning Milestone NFTs:** Earn badges + rewards for finishing coding levels, projects, or hackathons.    
- 💰 **Incentive Model:** Financial rewards at different levels (e.g., $10 for Level 2, up to $1,000 for major projects).    
- 🌐 **Ecosystem Utility:** Companies and DAOs access a talent pool with **provably verified skills**.    
- 🏆 **Leaderboard + HustleScore:** Rank builders globally based on their grind and contributions.    
- 👛 **POH Wallet:** A built-in wallet for P2P transfers, reward withdrawals, and future POH token support.

- **Opportunities are Borderless** 🌍    
  
By **2026**, our goal is:    
- 🚀 Onboard **1 million+ students & developers** into Web3.

## 🔌 APIs for Ecosystem Integration  
  
POH provides APIs to connect with key stakeholders in education and talent ecosystems:  
  
- **/university** → Universities verify student contributions, courses, and hackathon participation.    
- **/company** → Companies can post projects, bounties, and validate work submissions.    
- **/learning** → Platforms (Coursera, Udemy, etc.) can sync certifications + progress directly to POH.    
- **/dapp** → Developers integrate POH data into Web3 applications.    
  
These APIs ensure **automatic verification** of contributions, reducing fraud and building trust across the ecosystem.
