# 🚀 Proof-of-Hustle Protocol (POH)

**Proof-of-Hustle (POH)** is a **soulbound NFT protocol** that tracks, verifies, and rewards learning, coding, and contributions on-chain.  

Our mission is to transform **education and contributions** into **verifiable, on-chain achievements**, building a transparent system of reputation and incentives for the next generation of developers, students, and builders worldwide.  

POH = **Your Grind, On-Chain.**

## 🌍 Why Proof-of-Hustle?

Today, millions of students and developers work hard to learn coding, contribute to open source, or complete courses — but their progress often remains **invisible** to the world.  
- Resumes are outdated and unverifiable.  
- Contributions on GitHub or courses are fragmented.  
- Students, especially in emerging regions, lack financial support or recognition.  

**POH changes this.**  
By issuing **soulbound NFTs** that **auto-update** with each verified milestone, we create:  
- A **living, on-chain resume**.  
- **Proof of effort and learning** that no one can fake.  
- **Financial incentives** that reward grind and achievement.

## ✨ Features

- 🪪 **Soulbound NFTs (SBTs):** Non-transferable tokens that represent your unique learning journey.  
- ⚡ **Auto-Updating Reputation:** NFTs evolve as you complete courses, build projects, and contribute to GitHub/Devpost.  
- 🎓 **Learning Milestone NFTs:** Earn badges + rewards for finishing coding levels, projects, or hackathons.  
- 💰 **Incentive Model:** Financial rewards at different levels (e.g., $10 for Level 2, up to $1,000 for major projects).  
- 🌐 **Ecosystem Utility:** Companies and DAOs access a talent pool with **provably verified skills**.  
- 🏆 **Leaderboard + HustleScore:** Rank builders globally based on their grind and contributions.

## 🛠️ Vision

We believe in a world where:  
- **Education = Proof-of-Work** 🧑‍🎓  
- **Reputation is On-Chain** 🔗  
- **Opportunities are Borderless** 🌍  

By **2026**, our goal is:  
- 🚀 Onboard **1 million+ students & developers** into Web3.  
- 🌍 Provide **global visibility** for emerging talent from Africa, Asia, LATAM, and beyond.  
- 💡 Build the **standard protocol** for verifiable learning and contributions.
